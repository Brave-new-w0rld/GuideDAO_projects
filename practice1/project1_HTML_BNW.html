    <h2 id="Bio">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bio</h2>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banksy is a pseudonymous England-based street artist,
        political activist and film director whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of
        speculation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active since the 1990s, his satirical street art and
        subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti executed in a distinctive stenciling technique.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His works of political and social commentary have appeared
        on streets, walls and bridges throughout the world.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banksy's work grew out of the Bristol underground scene,
        which involved collaborations between artists and musicians.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banksy says that he was inspired by 3D, a graffiti artist
        and founding member of the musical group Massive Attack.

    <h2 id="Identity">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identity</h2>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banksy's name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject
        of speculation. In a 2003 interview with Simon Hattenstone<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of The Guardian, Banksy is described as "white, 28, scruffy
        casualâ€”jeans, T-shirt, a silver tooth, silver chain and silver earring.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banksy reportedly lived in Easton, Bristol during the late
        1990s, before moving to London around 2000.

    <h2 id="Technique">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technique</h2>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the secretive nature of Banksy's work and
        identity, it is uncertain what techniques he uses to generate the images in the stencils,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though it is assumed he uses computers for some images due
        to the photographic quality of much of his work.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentions in his book Wall and Piece that as he was
        starting to do graffiti, he was always either caught or could never finish the art in one sitting.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the
        police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then devised a series of intricate stencils to minimise
        time and overlapping of the colour.
